				<p>Argentina’s geology is quite diverse, giving it many different types of soils. Furthermore, the variety of altitudes throughout the Andes, has a deep influence on temperatures, creating many very different circumstances in which vines can grow. Within this vast diversity the group owns over 3000 ha from which we choose only the best plots of land from our best vineyards to make the finest wines Argentina has to offer for the Bemberg Estate Wines.</p>

		<h1>OUR WINEMAKER, DANIEL PI</h1>
		<h2>Bemberg Estate Wines, hand selected by our Chief Winemaker: Daniel Pi.</h2>
		<p>Daniel Pi is renowned as one of the best winemakers in Argentina. He has been working for Grupo Peñaflor since 1992. Daniel’s position as the group’s Winemaking and Viticulture Director has come from his expertise in traditional and innovative practices alongside his vast knowledge of Argentina’s diverse terroirs and valuable experience in viticulture and winemaking. Daniel Pi is also the Chief Winemaker for Trapiche. His wines have obtained some of the highest scores from some of the world’s most renowned critics.</p>

		<div class="pi-info" style="display: none;">
			<p>Without a doubt, this is the project I have been yearning for my entire professional life. I mean, being able to embark on an imaginary journey across Argentina's wine regions, across the family's vineyards, and summarize it in a range of wines... These vineyards boast exceptional quality value. Very often, the wines made from them only get to be enjoyed in rather limited amounts, when the winemakers get to taste them right off the barrels, tanks or casks where we keep them, and generally become part of our personal anthology. Being able to bottle these rare wines and share them with the family can truly give meaning to all the work that gets epitomized in a bottle of wine.</p>
			<p>What it is also extraordinary, is El Tomillo state. A place with an incredible quality to produce one of our best wines and where the winery will be placed. This estate is located in the district of Gualtallary, at 1,200 masl, in the province of Mendoza. The name comes from the abundant thyme that naturally grew on the virgin soil of the estate at the time of its establishment. I remember how the shrubs' typical aroma would burst every time we walked the land. For years and years, Marcelo Belmonte and I visited the estate and dreamed about what for us was still an elusive gem. Its best kept secret lies in the hidden potential of the lime subsoil, a substrate where roots go seeking just for the right mineral, but it is also a location where the climate offers a simply perfect balance of light and temperature conditions that favour wines of a very special character. Without a doubt, this is a unique spot.</p>
